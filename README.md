# List Helper for Sketch

This plugin allows you to save time generating and reducing lists. For the moment, it has two features:
- Generate horizontal or vertical list in a symbol from another symbol
- Reduce an instance number of elements to N elements

## Installation

- [Download](../../releases/latest/download/list-generator.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on list-generator.sketchplugin

## List generation from item symbol

## List reduction to N elements

## Roadmap & Ideas

List Helper is one of my side projects and I would like to maintain and add new features. Some of my ideas for the future:
- Change number of visible elements (showing previously hidden)
- JSON data load

If have an idea to improve List Helper, feel free for opening a pull request or contact with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/malakatonez) or by [mail me](mailto:hola@luciagomez.me) :)
